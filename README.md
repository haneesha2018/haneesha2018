I'm Haneesha, a software engineer passionate about leveraging AI and data-driven solutions to solve complex problems. 💻 From developing AI chatbots to creating interactive data visualizations, I thrive on using cutting-edge technologies to drive innovation and enhance decision-making processes.

When I'm not coding, you can find me:
🌍 Learning new languages on Duolingo, currently learning Spanish and French
🍳 Experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen
💪 Working out to stay active, I love running

These activities help me maintain a balanced lifestyle and fuel my creativity, complementing my passion for technology,  innovation and a love for continuous learning
I'm always eager to explore new technologies and methodologies in software engineering and AI. Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss innovative projects, collaborate on cutting-edge solutions, or exchange ideas about the latest in tech.
